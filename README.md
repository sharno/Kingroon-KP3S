I got a Kingroon KP3S 3.0 printer, still trying to figure things out but here's the resources that I found

# Slicers:
## PrusaSlicer profiles:
- Official from Kingroon: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17OpJVyVZrWrf6uncm1H41P58TKElGBk0
- Official video from Kingroon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAzWunhUIUQ
- It seems that there are tiny differences between the config from the video and from the files on google drive. But given that the files are a bit more recent, I think they should be the closest to perfect.
- I tried the video settings and I get some stringing in my prints (I might play with retraction settings and see if I can make it disappear)
- I'll update it here if I find that either is better than the other

## Cura profile:
- It has a default profile inside, when I tried it out, I got good prints but a visible Z scar most of the time
- PrusaSlicer made the Z scar disappear but got the stringing issue to deal with
- I'll try to see what are the differences between the official PrusaSlicer config and what Cura has by default and hopefully file some tickets to fix the Z scar.

From reddit:
- For the KP3S not PRO you can do the following:
- bed level locks https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4893883
- bed cable https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4942388
- z wire strap https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4942374
- PSU stand https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4766628
- spool holder https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3969208
- fan duct https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4942470
- 3d touch mount https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5197271
- changed to latest marlin firmware and used this screen case https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5319887
- replaced fans with Noctua 40x20 with some extra airflow
- removed the bed leveling knob and only use the 3D touch. And I can freely change from metal PEI to glass to other bed surfaces without changing the Z-offset.
